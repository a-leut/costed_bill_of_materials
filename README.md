# costed_bill_of_materials

Small web application to generate a costed bills of materials from spreadsheet input data. Pricing is done using an average of historical prices; these prices can be batch uploaded to the website. 

This was a project for my software engineering class where I served as the project manager. I taught my team members the basics of Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, HTML, and Git.
